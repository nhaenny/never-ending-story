This is essentially an endless madlib that remembers certain names and nouns throughout the whole story.

The purpose of the Never Ending Story is to help improve writing skills and increase your vocabulary as you're forced to think about different words that fit together and new ways your story can go that you never thought about. Like all madlibs, whatever you put in the blanks will kinda sorta not make sense or won't be grammatically correct at times, and that's okay. Read the story back with glossy eyes (don't read into it too much), and be creative as you try to connect the paragraphs and the inconsistent paragraphs.

There's currently about 40 different paragraphs that can be randomly loaded in upon filling out every blank field in your current paragraph. Each paragraph is relatively self-contained and intentionally generic. It's up to you to connect the dots between them as their transitions will often be rough. The blanks will tell you to insert 'verb' or 'preposition', but that's just a guideline; do what you want and be creative, or try your best to insert strictly what the blank requests and force yourself to think outside your normal vocabulary scope.
